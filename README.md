## What it does

The card gives you a visual overview of your air fryer at a glance — current temperature, time remaining, cooking status and a live progress bar. Tap the appliance to open a full configuration panel where you can set temperature and time with sliders, pick a cooking program, adjust texture, quantity and all the other settings the device supports.

Everything is wired directly to Home Assistant — no polling, no scripts, no helpers needed.

## Usage

Add the card to any Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:xiaomi-airfryer-card
device: careli_maf10a_1c99
language: en
```

Replace `careli_maf10a_1c99` with the entity prefix for your device. You can find it by looking at any of the air fryer entities in **Settings → Devices & Services** — it's everything before the last underscore-separated suffix (e.g. `_air_fryer`, `_left_time`, etc.).
